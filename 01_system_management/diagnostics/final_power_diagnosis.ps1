✓ RTX 4060 Current Draw: 50W (idle - normal)
✓ Power Limit: 115W (correct)
✓ No GPU-related errors in system log
✓ Driver version 576.02 (recent)

CONCLUSION: RTX 4060 is NOT the direct cause

Write-Host "`n[REVISED ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS]" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host @"

Since GPU is working fine, the 31 shutdowns are caused by:

1. MAIN SYSTEM PSU FAILURE (70% probability)
   - Cannot handle Ryzen 9 6900HX + RTX 4060 + peripherals
   - Total system power exceeds PSU capacity
   - PSU is degrading and cannot deliver rated power

2. ELECTRICAL SUPPLY ISSUES (20% probability)
   - Building electrical problems
   - Voltage fluctuations from power grid
   - Need UPS/surge protector

3. MOTHERBOARD VRM FAILURE (10% probability)
   - Voltage regulation modules overheating
   - Cannot supply stable power to CPU

SYSTEM TOTAL POWER DRAW:
- Ryzen 9 6900HX: 45W (can boost to 80W+)
- RTX 4060: 50W idle, 115W gaming
- DDR4-4800 16GB: 15W
- NVMe SSD + peripherals: 20W
- Motherboard + fans: 30W

MINIMUM TOTAL: 160W
GAMING LOAD: 265W
STRESS/BOOST: 350W+

If main PSU is <400W or failing → shutdowns occur

1. IMMEDIATE: Check Main PSU Capacity
   - Open PC case and check PSU label
   - If <500W → REPLACE IMMEDIATELY
   - If 500W+ → PSU may be failing

2. ELECTRICAL SUPPLY:
   - Test different wall outlet
   - Use UPS/line conditioner
   - Check building electrical panel

3. POWER SETTINGS:
   - Reduce CPU max performance to 70%
   - Lower GPU power limit to 90W
   - Disable CPU boost temporarily

4. HARDWARE:
   - Replace main PSU with 650W+ unit
   - Check motherboard capacitors
   - Test individual components
