## Target Server
- **IP Address**: 192.168.111.200
- **Assessment Score**: 75% (GOOD)
- **Primary OS**: Linux-based system (inferred)

## Network Performance
- **Ping Response**: 6ms (Excellent)
- **All Ports Accessible**: 笨・(22, 80, 8080, 3001)
- **Network Reliability**: High

## Service Analysis
- **SSH (Port 22)**: 笨・Active - Administrative access available
- **HTTP (Port 80)**: 笨・Active - Web server operational  
- **MCP (Port 8080)**: 笞・・Active but limited (501 error - method not implemented)
- **Application (Port 3001)**: 笨・Active - Application service running

## System Characteristics (Inferred)
- **Operating System**: Linux distribution
- **Service Architecture**: Multi-service environment
- **Remote Management**: SSH-based administration
- **Web Capabilities**: HTTP server with MCP integration

## Limitations of Current Analysis
- **Authentication Required**: SSH access needs credentials for detailed specs
- **Hardware Details**: CPU, memory, storage specifications require SSH access
- **Service Configuration**: Detailed service analysis needs system access
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time monitoring requires authenticated access

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Establish SSH Authentication**
   - Configure SSH key or password access
   - Enable detailed system information gathering
   
2. **Service Investigation**
   - Diagnose MCP service 501 error
   - Verify service configurations
   - Check application logs
   
3. **Performance Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement system monitoring
   - Set up alerting for critical metrics
   - Establish performance baselines
   
4. **Security Assessment**
   - Review firewall configurations
   - Audit service security settings
   - Implement access controls

## Next Analysis Phase
With SSH access, the following detailed information can be gathered:
- CPU: Architecture, cores, frequency, load
- Memory: Total capacity, usage patterns, swap configuration
- Storage: Disk capacity, file system usage, I/O performance
- Network: Interface configuration, traffic patterns
- Services: Detailed process analysis, resource consumption
